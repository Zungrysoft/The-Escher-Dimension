# The-Infinite-Dungeon
A procedural dungeon generator datapack for Minecraft. Explore the dungeons for enough resources to complete the victory monument! The datapack is getting pretty close to release, so everything should be in a working state minus some missing features, minor bugs, and balance testing.

Download the datapack by clicking Code->Download Zip

Run the datapack with the following steps:
- Open the "Create New World" menu in Minecraft 1.16.5
- Press the "Datapacks" button
- Drag the downloaded zip file into the left side of the menu
- Click on the arrow on the datapack to enable it
- Click "Done", select your difficulty, and create the world
- Wait for the first set of dungeons to generate and begin playing!
