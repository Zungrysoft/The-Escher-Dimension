# The Escher Dimension
A procedural dungeon generator datapack for Minecraft Java Edition. Explore the dungeons for enough resources to complete the victory monument! The datapack is very close to release, so everything should be in a working state.

- Open the "Create New World" menu in Minecraft Java Edition 1.16.5
- Click the "Datapacks" button
- Drag the zip file into the game menu
- Click on the arrow on the datapack to enable it. (It should be on the right-hand side of the screen.)
- Click "Done", select your difficulty, and create the world
- Wait for the first set of dungeons to generate and begin playing!
