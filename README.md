# The-Infinite-Dungeon
A procedural dungeon generator datapack for Minecraft. Explore the dungeons for enough resources to complete the victory monument! The repo might not currently be in a working state since I'm too lazy to bother with branch-and-pull for a hobby project :P

Download the latest working version here:

Run the datapack with the following steps:
Open the "Create New World" menu in Minecraft 1.16.3
Press the "Datapacks" button
Drag the downloaded zip file into the left side of the menu
Click on the arrow on the datapack to enable it
Click "Done", select your difficulty, and create the world
Wait for the first set of dungeons to generate and begin playing!
